# gundr
Discover underground music near you.

## Motivations
- Common social media in not tailored for the discovery of not-yet-popular music acts.
- Algorithms bury content and accounts that do not trigger engagement in favor of ones with a large one. This makes difficult to keep up to date with smaller accounts.
- Engagement is a flawed criteria to show news and updates. Thats why there are so much underground projects making cringy tiktoks instead of making music
- There is no exclusive place to form communities around music.

## Objectives
- Discover music acts near you.
- Get notified about news related to the projects and scenes you follow.
- Be community driven: Allow the formation of scenes around local music.
- But don't be limited by your geography, you can explore whatever you want. 

## Technical motivations
- I want to learn Go, this project happens to be something that I really want to exists, so why not apply what I'm learning in the process of materializing it?
- Want to put something public on _the internets_, trying to make a _real_ service is the only way to actually learn what it is necessary to do so.
